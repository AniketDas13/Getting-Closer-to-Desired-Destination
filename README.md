# Getting Closer to Desired Destination
CSE Project (under Design & Analysis of Algorithms) on 'Getting Closer to Desired Destination' using C
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem Statement:
You want to go to a place, say IIT Madras. You have no idea how IITM is connected to your current location, but you do know that going to the airport will get you closer to your destination. So, you go to the airport. Your current location just changed. You now look for another place to go to which will get you closer to IITM. The aeroplane seat seems like a good place. So, for any current location, we try to find a place X such that it gets us closer to our destination. We do this till we end up at our destination. Apply a design technique to solve the problem.

Problem Analysis:
The problem statement dictates us to reach a particular destination from the current location. So, we start to find a place that will take us closer to our destination and we move there. Now, our location changes and again, we repeat the process until we reach our destination. The objective is to find an optimal solution for the problem.

Hence, we are supposed to implement a correct algorithm, that will not only solve the problem but also, reduce the time complexity. The technique which will solve the problem efficiently in the minimum amount of time will be chosen as our ideal algorithm for solving the problem.
